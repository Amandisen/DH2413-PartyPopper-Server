        Party Popper is an asymmetrical multiplayer experience where two players
        collaborate with the joint goal to pop balloons. One player is in VR,
        popping balloons with the weapon of their choice. The second player is
        outside, sending balloons to the VR player through a web interface on a
        tablet. The balloons contain a variation of visual and sonic experiences
        which are revealed once they are popped. The second player steers the
        experience for the VR player by choosing what kind of balloons will be
        popped. The experience can be seen as both collaborative and competitive
        – depending on the mindset of the players involved. <br /><br />This
        experience was created as a part of the course DH2413 Advanced Graphics
        and Interaction in the autumn of 2022 and was displayed on Tekniska
        Museet for user testing on November 2.

        For the balloon explosion effects we used mainly particle systems with
        particle collisions to detect the point of intersection with the floor
        and walls in the room. All assets including the balloon residues, like
        the paint splats, the objects in the room and the tools and weapons used
        to interact with the balloons are created using Blender.
        <br /><br />To increase the performance in relation to the repeated
        instantiating and destroying of objects we used the object pool design
        pattern and implemented our own object pool for all of the balloon
        residues. We implemented our own shaders for the paint and water
        explosion using the Universal Render Pipeline… <br /><br />The
        interaction of the outside user was created as a deployed website on
        Heroku with a backend using Node js which sends information about which
        balloons to spawn to the VR interface using websockets.

        We debated between using the HTC Vive and Qculus Quest 2 but decided on
        the latter due to the full mobility afforded by not needing a cable
        connection during gameplay. However, that presented a big challenge in
        the trade off between performance and graphics. For example, our
        graphical quality would have greatly increased by applying an
        anti-aliasing filter, however after testing we decided against it since
        it put too much pressure on the performance. <br /><br />For version
        control we used Github, however from our experience it does not work
        great with Unity and we had quite a few merge conflicts throughout the
        project. <br /><br />One of our main goals was to expand the
        VR-experience outside of the VR-environment by creating a cross-platform
        experience with one player in VR and another on a tablet. A big
        challenge was therefore to provide an equally immersive and fun
        experience for both players. In line with Lee, Kim and Kim (2019) we
        tried to achieve this by defining clear roles for each of the players
        based on our core concept of a children's party. The tablet user could
        be imagined to be a friend or sibling and has an authorial role where
        they control the balloons in the VR-environment. Whilst the VR-player is
        the birthday person that in the aftermath of their party is popping the
        balloons, possibly happy with their party or angry with the presents
        received.

            RoleVR is a cross-platform game where the users had to collaborate
            with the aim of getting through a maze safely. The VR player moves
            his legs to walk around in the environment, and communicates what he
            sees to the non-VR user. The non-VR-user is in charge of the
            overview of the maze to see different patterns, checkpoints and is
            also in charge of dropping bombs and shields to protect the VR-user.
            <br /><br />This kind of interaction where the non-VR-user has an
            authorial role is something we also aimed to create in our project.
            In this project they highlight the importance of creating different
            roles for the different types of users

            ShareVR had a similar goal to ours, that is to allow non-VR-users to
            be included in the VR-experience and gain enjoyment from it. They
            developed a cross-platform system where the VR space is projected
            onto the floor and both users' movements are tracked. Based on
            testing, they present four guidelines for creating similar
            applications. One of which was to leverage the asymmetry, that is to
            utilize the inherent differences of the two users and platforms when
            designing the tasks. <br /><br />This was relevant for our project
            since we also aimed to create a cross-platform asymmetric
            interaction that engages both users and allows them both to affect
            the game, but without sharing the same physical space.

            In this project they created a VR painting tool, dubbed emoPaint,
            that allows the users to paint in 3D. As the name would indicate, it
            enables the users to create paintings that express their emotions
            using a range of parameters and different visual elements like color
            palettes, line textures and shapes. <br /><br />We also want to
            explore aspects of expressing emotion with our application by
            presenting the VR-user with balloons containing different pooping
            effects, like paint and lights, and add other aspects like sounds.
