      <div class="container__text--pink">
        Party Popper is an asymmetrical multiplayer experience where two players
        collaborate with the joint goal to pop balloons. One player is in VR,
        popping balloons with the weapon of their choice. The second player is
        outside, sending balloons to the VR player through a web interface on a
        tablet. The balloons contain a variation of visual and sonic experiences
        which are revealed once they are popped. The second player steers the
        experience for the VR player by choosing what kind of balloons will be
        popped. The experience can be seen as both collaborative and competitive
        – depending on the mindset of the players involved. <br /><br />This
        experience was created as a part of the course DH2413 Advanced Graphics
        and Interaction in the autumn of 2022 and was displayed on Tekniska
        Museet for user testing on November 2.

        For the balloon explosion effects, the water, paint and confetti
        balloons were created by using particle systems with particle collisions
        to detect the point of intersection with the floor and walls in the
        room. The deathstar and discoball were created in Blender and scripts
        for adding new background music, turning of lights and creating rotation
        and movement were added in Unity. The bouncy balls are spheres made in
        Unity with physical material. All assets including the balloon residues,
        like the paint splats, the objects in the room and the tools and weapons
        used to interact with the balloons are created using Blender.
        <br /><br />To increase the performance in relation to the repeated
        instantiating and destroying of objects we used the object pool design
        pattern and implemented our own object pool for all of the balloon
        residues. We implemented our own shaders for the paint and water
        explosion using the Universal Render Pipeline. <br /><br />The
        interaction of the outside user was created as a deployed website on
        Heroku with a backend using Node.js which sends information about which
        balloons to spawn to the VR interface using websockets. <br /><br />
        The background music is from freesound.org. The balloon popping sounds
        are licensed from Epidemic Sound. The Deathstar 3D asset is from
        CGSheep, party banner 3D assets are from Robot Skeleton, the rug texture
        is from Nobiax/Yughues, the skybox is from Avionx, and the floor texture
        is from Innovana Games.

        We debated between using the HTC Vive and Qculus Quest 2 but decided on
        the latter due to the full mobility afforded by not needing a cable
        connection during gameplay. However, that presented a big challenge in
        the trade off between performance and graphics. For example, our
        graphical quality would have greatly increased by applying an
        anti-aliasing filter, however after testing we decided against it since
        it put too much pressure on the performance. <br /><br />For version
        control we used Github, however from our experience it does not work
        great with Unity and we had quite a few merge conflicts throughout the
        project. <br /><br />One of our main goals was to expand the
        VR-experience outside of the VR-environment by creating a cross-platform
        experience with one player in VR and another on a tablet. A big
        challenge was therefore to provide an equally immersive and fun
        experience for both players. In line with Lee, Kim and Kim (2019) we
        tried to achieve this by defining clear roles for each of the players
        based on our core concept of a children's party. The tablet user could
        be imagined to be a friend or sibling and has an authorial role where
        they control the balloons in the VR-environment. Whilst the VR-player is
        the birthday person that in the aftermath of their party is popping the
        balloons, possibly happy with their party or angry with the presents
        received.

      <div class="container__text--blue">
        As previously mentioned one of the major aspects for us to keep in mind
        when developing Party Popper was the performance. We learnt different
        aspects that put a lot of pressure on the performance like having
        shadows in the scene, but also different methods to increase the
        performance like using the object pool design pattern.
        <br /><br />During our testing we learned of the importance of not hard
        coding anything. For example, when we tested on children at Tekniska we
        quickly realized that the height of the balloons were out of reach for
        children and had to quickly change this. Also, it is important to have a
        lot of space when testing VR projects as users tend to forget about
        their surroundings. <br /><br />It is important to formulate a goal
        early but to not be too fixated on that idea. Initially, we aimed at
        making a creative experience where the room was a white canvas for the
        user to express themselves with the different popped materials. However,
        we realized early on that interacting with the balloons, like boxing
        them, was more fun than the mark they left behind. This made us
        brainstorm new types of weapons and interactions that could be done with
        the balloons. We also left the idea that everything inside the balloons
        had to leave a mark and instead implemented things that disappeared
        after a while, like the disco balloon. Changing the room from a
        completely white space to a home environment with a few party
        decorations also put the user in a context so that we didn’t have to
        explain the setting. Our idea had evolved from being an artistic
        expression to just creating a fun experience where you can make a mess,
        partly controlled by the outside participant.

            RoleVR is a cross-platform game where the users had to collaborate
            with the aim of getting through a maze safely. The VR player moves
            his legs to walk around in the environment, and communicates what he
            sees to the non-VR user. The non-VR-user is in charge of the
            overview of the maze to see different patterns, checkpoints and is
            also in charge of dropping bombs and shields to protect the VR-user.
            <br /><br />This kind of interaction where the non-VR-user has an
            authorial role is something we also aimed to create in our project.
            In this project they highlight the importance of creating different
            roles for the different types of users

            ShareVR had a similar goal to ours, that is to allow non-VR-users to
            be included in the VR-experience and gain enjoyment from it. They
            developed a cross-platform system where the VR space is projected
            onto the floor and both users' movements are tracked. Based on
            testing, they present four guidelines for creating similar
            applications. One of which was to leverage the asymmetry, that is to
            utilize the inherent differences of the two users and platforms when
            designing the tasks. <br /><br />This was relevant for our project
            since we also aimed to create a cross-platform asymmetric
            interaction that engages both users and allows them both to affect
            the game, but without sharing the same physical space.

            In this project they created a VR painting tool, dubbed emoPaint,
            that allows the users to paint in 3D. As the name would indicate, it
            enables the users to create paintings that express their emotions
            using a range of parameters and different visual elements like color
            palettes, line textures and shapes. <br /><br />We also want to
            explore aspects of expressing emotion with our application by
            presenting the VR-user with balloons containing different pooping
            effects, like paint and lights, and add other aspects like sounds.
